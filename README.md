## My process

### Built with

- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was both the second project I did with Vue.js and Tailwind CSS so i learned some more about those. I struggled a little bit with getting the images positioned correctly so I guess you could say I learned a little about that too.
